\chapter{Installation setup}
\label{cha:installation}

To install the project we basically followed the guide in the README markdown on Github. We cloned the project, imported as a Maven project and after downloading every dependencies from the pom.xml file, started compiling. Since we are used to using IntelliJ IDEA, we thought - for simplicity's sake - to give it a try with such IDE without installing another one. It seemed it worked, the project compiled correctly, but an error occurred when we have tried to launch the Travlendar+ web application - more precisely in the calendar page -, and we got: \textit{Widgetset 'com.vaadin.DefaultWidgetSet' does not contain an implementation for org.vaadin.addon.calendar.Calendar. Check the connector's @Connect mapping, the widgetset's GWT module description file and re-compile your widgetset}. We've seen however that they experienced the same error as well, but neither with their suggestion it worked.
So we just changed dev-environment, switching to NetBeans IDE, the one the project was developed with, configured MySQL properly, and finally the web application worked.
