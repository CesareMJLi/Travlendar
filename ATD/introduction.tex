\section{About}
\label{sec:about}
We were asked to test the project by Fumagalli, Grotti and Gullo (here's the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo}{link}). We mainly considered the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/ITD1.pdf}{ITD} and the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/RASD.pdf}{RASD} documents. Particularly, we analyzed the functionalities detailed in the ITD and made a comparison with what the application is meant to do.
