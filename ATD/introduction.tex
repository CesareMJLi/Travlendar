\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

This document has the purpose to show the results of the tests carried out on the Travlendar+ project of another group.

\section{Scope}
We could not find inconsistencies between the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/RASD.pdf}{RASD} and the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/DD1.pdf}{DD}, that appeared very well related. We mainly considered the \href{https://github.com/Aestor/FumagalliGrottiGullo/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/ITD1.pdf}{ITD}.\\Our team decided to focus on verifying the goals and requirements that the other team claimed to have successfully implemented, checking if errors or anomalies occurred.\\In testing section is possible to see if any trouble or errors came out in web application.
