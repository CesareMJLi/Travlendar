\chapter{Architectural Design}
\label{cha:arch}
\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
This section presents a panoramic overview of the architectural component of the application.
Beginning with a high-level approach towards a more detailed and deeper level of the technologies.
We will discuss the how and why we have chosen the technologies that we will use in the development of the clients and which backend solution.
\newline Travlendar+ will rely on the AWS technology, that will allow us a fast development phase and a modular scalability. 
This will enable to have a degree of flexibility that cannot be achieved through hosting and implementing our own architecture in the traditional way.
Accessing the AWS services is going to be doable thanks to the AWS SDK's available that helps to take out of coding the complexity of accessing them providing wrapped APIs in every major technology that could be used to implement the clients.
In our case, the mobile clients will be implemented with the Xamarin.Forms technology that will help us to achieve a multi-platform solution with an excellent code-sharing approach.
Xamarin.Forms allow us to develop quickly native iOS/Android/Windows applications in C\# having native UI elements and access to platform-specific APIs.
The web application will be based on Angular.js and HTML5.
Angular.js is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for web applications, it allows to have a rapid development and its maintained by Google Engineers meaning that you will find reliable support if needed.
It perfectly integrates with HTML5 and its fully compatibly with the MVVM approach

\section{Component view}
\label{sec:comp_view}
The following views will cover the major components and technologies that the system uses.

\textbf{Client:} Implementation of the application that makes requests to the server and will be provided with a response. In Travlendar+ the clients will be the mobile application and the web application, that interacts with the server through REST APIs.

\textbf{Server:} Layer that provides the workflow and the business logic for the client applications. It will be implemented with AWS technologies interacting with a different component for each type of client.

\textbf{Web Server:} Software running on a server able to communicate with web application clients using the HTTP (or HTTPS) protocol.

\textbf{Application Server:} Server that provides the infrastructure and the functionalities needed to the application

\textbf{AWS:} Cloud services that offer computing power, database storage, content delivery and other scalable functionalities.

\textbf{Xamarin:} Technology that delivers native Android, iOS and Windows applications using a shared C\# codebase and the same APIs.

\textbf{Web Browser:} Application for retrieving and presenting web pages and applications.
