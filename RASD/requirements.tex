\section{Performance Requirements}
\label{sec:perf_req}
The user experience across the application should be fluid and with zero waiting time moving between the sections. Besides, there are a number of requirements that implies third party information retrieved through asynchronous requests so, the previous requirement can allow some tolerance.

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is no limit to the number of users registered to the application.

\item The date text fields have to validate dates in real time.
\item The application going back to foreground has to be in the same state as when it was going to background
