## About
Software Engineering II project carried out during the academic year 2017/18 @[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/home/). A full description of the context can be found [here](http://score-contest.org/2018/projects/travlendar.php). We were asked to develop four subprojects: the first two of them are theoretically based (mandatory), the other two are about the implementation (optional). They are briefly explained below but check out the _Deliverables_ folder for further info.

### RASD
Short for _Requirements Analysis and Specification Document_. We give an initial introduction of the problem, all the goals and the functional and nonfunctional requirements are illustrated thereafter. Several diagrams such as UMLs, of sequence and statecharts are associated for most of the use cases. Finally a possible model of the context is shown using Alloy.

### DD
Short for _Design Document_. We present the underlying architectural and design patterns of Travlendar (such as MVVM, SoC, High Cohesion and IoC) as well as the user interface and the interactions among various components and the algorithms; by specifying in details the requirements previously shown in the RASD.

### ITD
Short for _Implementation and Test Document_. We developed a cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile application using Xamarin.Forms as framework. Just note that the login is handled with a third-part service and we used AWS Cognito to store data on the server. We did both tuning and testing (TDD). Here are some screenshots (others at _ITD Document/screenshots_).

### ATD
Short for _Acceptance Test Document_. We evaluated another's group project and tested it.
